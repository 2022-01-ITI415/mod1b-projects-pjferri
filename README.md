 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1

I am going to call my game Castle Defender! Essentially, my idea is to have hoards of enemies moving from the right towards your castle on the left. Using your slingshot you have to launch cannon balls at the enemies before they reach the castle gates! If the enemies reach the castle its game over. See how long you can survive. The prototype is setup and working great. I would love it if you check it out! In the future I would love to expand on this idea by adding new features like an in-game shop where you can upgrade the slingshot, projectiles, or castle. I would also love to add additional enemies that get increasingly more difficult to defeat. 

For the prototype, I used the MDA framework of starting with a mechanic (slingshot and moving enemies) and then aimed towards triggering a feeling of the player being overwhelmed, but in a fun way. I wanted the player to feel the stress of having to take down a swarm of enemies with just a slingshot and enjoy that challenge.
